# Outfit Today

This project shows the appropriate outdoor attire based on the current weather as well as offer dress recommendations based on projections for the near future. Data was studied primarily with reference to Finland, and clothing suggestions are made in accordance with daycare suggestions.  In Finland, all childcare and schoolchildren play outdoors in all weather conditions. We also noticed Finland's fast weather changes. So, parents need to plan ahead for the clothing they will need for the day, and childcare providers need to frequently teach kids what to wear outside. Also, it has been observed that new immigrants find it difficult to dress appropriately given the weather. Hence, in an effort to make everyone's lives easier, we decided to start this program.
